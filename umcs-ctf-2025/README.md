## 🏆 UMCS CTF 2025 – Blockchain Challenge Writeups

This folder contains my personal writeups and exploit scripts for the UMCS CTF 2025 which organized by Persatuan Komputer Universiti Malaya (PEKOM) at University Malaya (UM). The focus of this repo is on the blockchain challenges from the event, which I successfully solved.

This was my first physical CTF competition, and glad to manage to get 3rd place in the final! Huge appreciation to my team, Formal Sweatpants, for the teamwork and support throughout the event.

This experience furthered my interest in smart contract security and blockchain hacking.
